## About Me
Hello there! I’m coderCleric, an enthusiast for games, programming, and game programming. I’m a member of the Outer Wilds modding community, having helped make mods such as [Forgotten Castaways](https://github.com/coderCleric/DeepBramble) and [Heliostudy](https://github.com/2walker2/OWJam5ModProject). I’ve also created mods for other games as well, such as [Poltergeist](https://github.com/coderCleric/Poltergeist) for Lethal Company and [Handwarmer](https://github.com/coderCleric/Handwarmer) for Hollow Knight: Silksong. If you want to know more about these projects (or look at other projects of mine), feel free to poke through my profile!

## Contact Me
If you need to get in contact with me, I go by coderCleric on the Outer Wilds, Lethal Company, and Silksong modding Discords. Alternatively, you can shoot me an email at coderCleric@gmail.com.
